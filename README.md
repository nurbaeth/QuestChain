🏆 QuestChain – On-Chain Quest System
QuestChain is a gamified on-chain quest system that allows players to complete tasks and earn rewards, all while interacting with the blockchain. The contract offers multiple stages, where each stage requires a specific action or condition to be met. Whether it's transferring tokens, signing a message, or interacting with other contracts, players can experience a trustless and transparent journey as they complete the quest.

✨ Features
✅ Multiple Stages – Complete various tasks to advance through the quest.
✅ Reward Mechanism – Earn ERC-20 tokens or other assets for completing each stage.
✅ Trustless & Transparent – All steps and rewards are handled on-chain.
✅ Gamified Experience – A fun way to learn and interact with blockchain technology.
✅ Customizable – Create new quests, stages, and reward systems.

📜 How It Works
1️⃣ Start Your Quest
Players begin their journey by interacting with the contract, starting from Stage 1.
You can define your quest with custom tasks for each stage.
2️⃣ Complete Tasks 
Each stage of the quest involves a specific action, such as:
Stage 1: Send a small amount of tokens.  
Stage 2: Sign a predefined message to prove your knowledge.
Stage 3: Interact with another contract or perform an action on the blockchain.
3️⃣ Claim Your Reward
After completing all stages, players can claim their reward, which could be a predefined amount of tokens, NFTs, or other assets.
🔧 How to Use
Deploy the Contract
Deploy the QuestChain contract on Ethereum or any compatible network.
Provide the contract address of the ERC-20 token that will be used as the reward.
Start the Quest
Players begin by calling completeStage1().
Each stage requires specific actions, which must be completed sequentially.
After completing Stage 3, players can claim their reward using claimReward().
🛠 Example Workflow
Stage 1: The player interacts by sending tokens (or any other predefined action).
Stage 2: The player signs a secret or completes a cryptographic task.
Stage 3: The player interacts with a third-party contract or performs another action.
Final Stage: The player can claim their reward once all steps are complete.
🛠 Deployment & Testing
Compile the contract with Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry.
Deploy it to any Ethereum-compatible network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli).
Use Etherscan, Remix, or any custom front-end to interact with the contract.
Testing: Write unit tests using Hardhat or Truffle to check the flow of the quest system.
🎯 Future Features
